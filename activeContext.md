# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial Memory Bank setup for portfolio website project. This is the first session with this project.

## Recent Decisions
1. Created comprehensive Memory Bank structure to ensure continuity across sessions
2. Documented project as single-page portfolio website for Harshit Chaturvedi
3. Identified portfolio purpose: Showcase transition from Frontend Engineer to Product Manager
4. Documented technical stack: Static HTML with Tailwind CSS CDN

## Project Insights
1. **Unique Positioning**: Portfolio specifically targets PM/APM roles, not typical engineering positions
2. **Dual Background**: Combines 5+ years engineering experience with MBA in IT
3. **Entrepreneurial Angle**: HC BYTES education platform demonstrates product ownership
4. **Modern Design**: Uses contemporary animations and visual patterns to demonstrate technical competence
5. **Clear CTA**: Contact section explicitly states current job search focus

## Current State
- **Phase**: Deployed portfolio website (complete)
- **Status**: Awaiting user guidance on next tasks or improvements
- **Blockers**: None
- **Next Actions**: TBD based on user needs

## Questions for User
- Are there specific improvements or features to add?
- Any content updates needed?
- Performance or SEO optimization desired?
- New sections or functionality to implement?

## Technical Notes
- Portfolio is self-contained in single HTML file
- No build process or dependencies beyond CDN resources
- Easy to deploy to any static hosting platform
- Mobile-responsive with modern animations

## Recent Context (Session)
- User greeted with "hello"
- I read existing index.html file
- Created Memory Bank files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md
- Currently completing activeContext.md, progress.md, and .clinerules
- Will then acknowledge user and offer assistance

## Pattern Recognition
- Portfolio follows modern SPA design patterns
- Uses utility-first CSS approach (Tailwind)
- Emphasizes visual appeal with subtle animations
- Clean information hierarchy for recruiter scanning
- Professional color palette (Sky blue primary)

## Opportunities Identified
1. Could add social proof (testimonials, recommendations)
2. Could implement analytics for traffic insights
3. Could add OpenGraph/Twitter cards for better social sharing
4. Could create blog section to showcase thought leadership
5. Could add project case studies to demonstrate PM thinking
6. Could implement dark mode for user preference
7. Could add contact form with backend integration
