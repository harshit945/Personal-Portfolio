# Current Task: GitHub Repository Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## Task Overview
Successfully deployed portfolio website to GitHub using personal credentials.

## Implementation Steps - All Complete

### 1. Repository Configuration ✅
- Initialized Git repository
- Configured local Git credentials (personal, not global)
  - Email: harshitchaturvedi945@gmail.com
  - Username: harshit945
- Remote: https://github.com/harshit945/Personal-Portfolio.git

### 2. Credential Management ✅
- Cleared cached office credentials (harshit-juspay)
- Disabled credential helper to avoid conflicts
- Used Personal Access Token for authentication
- Cleaned up remote URL after push (token removed)

### 3. Deployment ✅
- Committed all files:
  - Portfolio website (index.html)
  - Memory Bank documentation (7 markdown files)
- Pushed to GitHub successfully
- Repository verified live at: https://github.com/harshit945/Personal-Portfolio

## Key Learnings
1. **Credential Separation**: Used local Git config to keep personal and office credentials separate
2. **PAT Authentication**: Personal Access Tokens are required for HTTPS authentication
3. **Security**: Always clean up URLs after pushing to avoid exposing tokens

## Next Steps
- Consider enabling GitHub Pages to host the portfolio website
- Set up automatic deployments if needed
- Update portfolio content as career progresses
