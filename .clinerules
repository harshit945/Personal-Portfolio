# Project Intelligence - Portfolio Website

## User Preferences & Workflow

### Development Approach
- **Keep it Simple**: Single HTML file, no build process, minimal dependencies
- **CDN First**: Prefer CDN-hosted libraries (Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts)
- **Static Deployment**: No server-side rendering, pure static HTML
- **Modern Standards**: Use latest CSS features, semantic HTML5

### Design Philosophy
- **Professional First**: Clean, corporate aesthetic targeting recruiters
- **Subtle Animations**: Eye-catching but not distracting
- **Sky Blue Palette**: Primary color #0284c7 (Sky 600), secondary #e0f2fe (Sky 100)
- **Responsive Always**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Information Hierarchy**: Clear scanning path for busy recruiters

### Content Strategy
- **PM Focus**: Emphasize product management transition, not just engineering
- **Business + Tech**: Showcase dual competency (MBA + 5 years engineering)
- **Clear CTAs**: Direct calls to action for PM/APM opportunities
- **Credibility Markers**: Certifications, MBA, research, entrepreneurship (HC BYTES)

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Adding New Sections
1. Follow existing section pattern:
   ```html
   <section id="section-name" class="py-24 bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm relative z-10">
     <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6">
       <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-12 text-center text-slate-900">Section Title</h2>
       <!-- Content -->
     </div>
   </section>
   ```
2. Add navigation link in nav element
3. Maintain consistent spacing (py-24)
4. Use max-w-4xl or max-w-6xl container

### Modifying Animations
- All animations defined in `<style>` block in `<head>`
- Key animations: fadeInUp, float, gradient, hover-lift, pulse-glow
- Use delay classes: delay-100, delay-200, delay-300, delay-400
- Stagger animations for visual hierarchy

### Color System Usage
- **Primary actions**: bg-primary (Sky 600)
- **Highlights**: bg-secondary (Sky 100/200)
- **Text hierarchy**: text-slate-900 (headings) → text-slate-600 (body) → text-slate-400 (muted)
- **Borders**: border-slate-100
- **Shadows**: shadow-sm, shadow-lg, shadow-xl

### Responsive Patterns
- **Grid**: `grid md:grid-cols-2` for desktop two-column
- **Text size**: `text-5xl md:text-7xl` for responsive typography
- **Spacing**: `mb-6` mobile, increase for desktop if needed
- **Navigation**: `hidden md:flex` for desktop-only nav items

## Known Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Keeping Single File Maintainable
**Solution**: Clear HTML structure with comments for major sections, inline CSS organized by purpose (animations, utilities, custom classes)

### Challenge: CDN Dependencies
**Solution**: Accept trade-off for simplicity - no build process needed. Can self-host later if needed.

### Challenge: Contact Form Without Backend
**Solution**: Use mailto: link for now. If backend needed, consider Netlify Forms or similar serverless solution.

### Challenge: SEO for Single Page App
**Solution**: Add comprehensive meta tags, structured data, and ensure semantic HTML. Consider adding blog subdirectory if content strategy expands.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Dec 14, 2025 - Initial Assessment
- Recognized project as complete, production-ready portfolio
- Identified unique positioning: Technical PM vs typical engineering portfolio
- Documented clean single-file architecture
- Created comprehensive Memory Bank for continuity

## Tool Usage Patterns

### File Modifications
- **Preferred**: Use `edit_block` for targeted changes to index.html
- **Avoid**: Rewriting entire file unless major restructuring
- Always verify changes with user before multiple edits

### Testing Approach
- Use `execute_command` with `open index.html` to test in browser
- Can use browser_action for visual verification if needed
- Test responsive breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px+

## Coding Style Preferences

### HTML
- Semantic elements (nav, header, section)
- Tailwind utility classes (long class strings acceptable)
- Self-closing tags where appropriate
- 2-space indentation

### CSS
- Inline styles in `<style>` block
- Organized by: base styles → animations → utilities → custom classes
- Use Tailwind config for theme customization
- kebab-case for custom class names

### JavaScript
- Minimal to none (CSS-only preferred)
- If needed: vanilla JS, no frameworks
- Inline in `<script>` tag at end of body

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Single File?
- Simplicity: No build process, easy deployment
- Performance: Minimal HTTP requests
- Maintainability: Everything in one place for small project
- Portability: Can send single file, works anywhere

### Why Tailwind CDN?
- No npm dependencies
- Just-in-time compilation
- Easy customization via embedded config
- Reduced development friction

### Why Static HTML?
- Portfolio doesn't need dynamic content
- Fast load times
- Easy hosting (free options available)
- No backend security concerns

## Important Patterns

### Resume Link Pattern
- External Google Drive link
- `target="_blank"` for new tab
- Should update when resume changes

### External Links Pattern
- All external links use `target="_blank"`
- **TODO**: Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security

### Timeline Pattern (Experience Section)
- Left border with absolute positioned markers
- Primary color for current role, gray for past
- Responsive: stacks on mobile, inline on desktop

### Animation Pattern
- Entry animations on hero section only
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Continuous animations for decorative elements
- Performance: Use transform and opacity (GPU accelerated)
